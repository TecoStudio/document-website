Frequently Asked (and Answered) Questions

::: details How do I enable or disable LevelledMobs in certain worlds, or for certain mobs?
```yaml
conditions:
  worlds: ['*']
  #biomes: ['*']
  entities: ['*']
```
As part of the **Default Rule**, in your `rules.yml` file, locate the above configuration options.

You can edit what worlds are `included` or `excluded` by editing these settings.

For example, if you want to change it so that LevelledMobs works on *all world except for a world called `player_farms`*, then you'd change `worlds:` to read:

```yaml
worlds:
  excluded-list: ['player_farms']
```

For another example, if you wanted to change it so that LevelledMobs only works on the world called `danger_zone`, then you'd change `worlds:` to read:

```yaml
worlds:
  included-list: ['player_farms']
```

The same method can be used for *entities*.

::: details Can LevelledMobs stop mobs from spawning?
**Never Has, Never Will

This has been policy of our plugin since it's earliest days of existence.

We have intentionally avoided any actions which affect the `mobQueue` or can change the spawning rate, mechanics, or behavior regarding the spawning of mobs. We recognized early on that this is the source of many conflicts between plugins working in similar fields and on the same or similar functions, conflicting with each other.

In general, the way LevelledMobs works is by employing a wide range of listener systems which are listening for things like chunk loads, entity spawns, damage events, etc. If LevelledMobs detects a mob it will first determine if that mob has finished 'spawning'. If it has, then it will determine whether that mob should receive a level based on the current ruleset. If it does, then LevelledMobs will store a large amount of data onto the mob itself which contains much of the settings which LevelledMobs uses to identify and modify the entities. If the entity is not allowed to be levelled, whatever the reason, then that entity will have most of LevelledMobs' data removed and it will be ignored by the plugin until such time that it becomes levellable (due to a change in the rules or environment/condition check).

::: details Will LevelledMobs make my server lag? <br/> My Spark/Profiler Report said your plugin is using a lot of resources?!
Incredibly unlikely!

Even with servers running very thin resource margins,k we have had little issue with regards to lag. We also maintain relationship with a few server owners using owner plugin whose player counts ranges from 50 - 400, and the receipts from these live tests show our plugin is highly performant under typical and atypical server environments.

With each major update we perform a stress-test which covers the nametag, custom drops, and strategy calculating systems;the three highest-price resources we utilize. Even under uncommon situations where several thousand mobs exist in a small field of chunks visible to multiple players, each processing a unique level strategy and a choosing from a set of randomly damaged armors, there was no noticeable increase in lag or TPS drops.

Specific to Spark and Profiler reports; these are almost always a misunderstanding of what the report is actually saying. I cannot remember a case in four years of development where a single report brought to our attention by the general public was representative of a valid concern. If you possess the knowledge-base necessary to analyze these reports, we encourage you to report any issues you may see. Otherwise, we ask that you check more appropriate areas for support regarding your server's performance issues.

:::

::: details Will LevelledMobs give players increased XP or Items?
Yes!

By default, this increase is set to 300% for items and 500% for xp when at the max level of a mob. These values can be changed in the config, removed entirely, or when combined with the **Death-inChunk Limiter**, put the feature on a cooldown.

Levelled mobs have increased health, damage output, and speed; making them a challenge worth rewarding with a bit of extra XP or Items. If you or your server disagree, you can edit any of the above mentioned values.
:::

::: details How do I remove nametags from passive mobs?
Locate the following (or similar) custom rule in your default `rules.yml` file:

```yaml
  - custom-rule: 'Reduced Nametag Visibility'
    is-enabled: true
    conditions:
      entities:
        included-groups: [ 'all_passive_mobs' ]
        included-list: [ 'BAT' ]
        excluded-list: [ 'IRON_GOLEM' ]
    settings:
      nametag-visibility-method: [ 'MELEE', 'ATTACKED' ]
```

And change the *nametag visibility method* to read `nametag-visibility-method: DISABLED`

This will disable the nametag feature for all passive mobs, plus bats (as they are strangely not considered Passive by Minecraft's standard).

- Since `4.0.5 b23`, once a nametag is disabled it may require players to relog to update the nametages as invisible.
:::

::: details How do I change the drops of a mob?
Use our [Custom Drops](https://arcaneplugins.gitbook.io/levelledmobs-the-ultimate-mob-levelling-solution/the-default-files/customdrops.yml) system!

The Custom Drops feature provides an easy to use, easy to scale config allowing you to create lists or tables of items to apply to mobs. These items can be set as drops, as wearable equipment, or usable items placed in the mobs' hands. You can reward players with commands, with items from several supported 3rd party plugins, with vanilla items and more; adjusting the output based on any number and combination of factors.

It is recommended to use the Custom Drops system by creating Drop Tables, and then by implementing those Drop Tables via a Custom RUle. You can see an example in the Sample Custom Rules.
:::

::: details What levelling strategies are available?
With LevelledMobs4, you can combine multiple levelling *strategies* together to form a final numerical level value, or use each strategy on an individual basis.

- **Weighted Random (enabled by default)** <br/> Uses a random selection method, where the highest level possible has the lowest chance to occur and the lowest level possible has the highest chance to occur. THis can be modified to set level specific weights to the random selection.
- **Random** <br/> This is true random levelling. Any level between the minimum and maximum can be selected.
- **Distance-from-Origin** <br/> Previously *distance-from-spawn*, this strategy allows you to establish center-point, and ever expanding rings from that point will gradually increase the level value of mobs based on your distance settings. The *blended* addon from LM3 was incorporated into the main setting with LM4, allowing for the height above or below a certain threshold to affect the final output number (by default, higher values in the caves, lower values in the mountains). Useful for a more expansive world like the End.
- **Y-Coordinate** (enabled by default) <br/> This strategy takes a starting world height and sets the lowest level available at that height and higher, then takes the ending world height and sets the highest level available at that height and lower. Useful for a more vertical world like the Nether.

As well, as have multiple *modifiers* which can apply an additional metric to adjust the final applied level to a mob.

- **Player Level Modifier** (enabled by default) <br/> Previously the strategy *player-variable-levelling*, this modifier can take the PlaceholderAPI [PAPI] placeholder tags produced by other 3rd party plugins, as well as a handful of our own internal placeholders, and combine them to form a numerical basis to adjust the level of mobs.
- **Random Variance Modifier** (enabled by default) <br/> This modifier simply selects a random number between the established values; useful for applying a random degree of variance to final applied levels.
:::

::: details How do I change difficulty of mobs? <br/> The mobs are too hard?!
We provide five unique and play-tested levelling *Challenges* that you can easily shift between.
```yaml
#===== Choose a Challenge =====
#- challenge-vanilla
#- challenge-bronze
- challenge-silver
#- challenge-gold
#- challenge-platinum
#- challenge-formula
```
By default, we use the *Silver Challenge*. You can shift up to the *Bronze* challenge for a reduced difficulty, or down to the *Gold* or *Platinum* challenge which requires skill to handle.

Or you can craft your own *Challenge* **Preset** by copying any of the other presets and giving it a unique name, then altering the attribute values to suit your servers' needs.
:::

::: details How do I change to a different leveling strategy?
With LevelledMobs4, you can combine multiple levelling *Strategies* Together to form a final numerical level value or use each strategy on an individual basis.

Each *strategy* produces it's own placeholder tag representing the output from that strategy. For example, the strategy type *distance-from-origin* produces an internal-use placeholder tag `%distance-from-origin%` which outputs the numerical value of that *strategy*.

Under the *Default Rule*, we include several presets which can be easily enabled or disabled to active or deactivate different strategies. 
```yaml
#===== Choose Strategies =====
#- lvlstrategy-random
- lvlstrategy-weighted-random
#- lvlstrategy-distance-from-origin
- lvlstrategy-y-coordinate

#===== Choose Modifiers =====
- lvlmodifier-player-variable
- lvlmodifier-random-variance
```
Simply remove or add in the `#` to enable or disable the different *strategies* presets.

Once you've settled onn your strategies, locate the `construct-level: ` under **Default Rule** ad modify it to only include the activated strategies and how you'd like those strategies' output to be reflected.
```yaml
construct-level: '(%weighted-random% / 2) + (%y-coordinate% / 5) + %player-variable-mod% + %random-variance-mod%'
```
For example, if I had only left `1lvlstrategy-weighted-random` and `lvlmodifier-random-variance` enabled, then I might change the `construct-level:` to reflect that change:

```yaml
construct-level: '(%weighted-random% / %random-variance-mod%) + %random-variance-mod%'
```
:::

::: details How can I make a mob from plugin X levelled?
With LevelledMobs4, we include the new `externalplugins.yml` file. This allows you to establish your own external plugin support by providing commonly used plugin-specific identifiers within a mobs PersistentDataContainer [PDC] or it's Metadata.
:::

::: details How can I translate the names of mobs?
ASll mobs using their default names will have those names automatically translated into the language set by the Minecraft client the player is using, meaning every player may see the default names differently based on their set language settings. 

If this is not enough, we also include the `entity-name-overide:` setting which allows you to specify certain mob types and provide a randomly selected  series of names for these mob types to be given. While these cannot be automatically translated, it does allow for unique varieties of the same mob by a simple name change.
:::

::: details How can I increase an attribute above 2048?
LevelledMobs does not limit this value, it's your server software.

In the `spigot.yml` of your servers' software files, locate this section:

```yaml
attribute:
  maxHealth:
    max: 2048.0
  movementSpeed:
    max: 2048.0
  attackDamage:
    max: 2048.0
```

We recommend changing these values to a higher number.

NOTE: Minecraft's programming isn't designed to handle exceptionally large numbers. We recommend limiting your increase to `max:1000000.0`. Higher value can cause crashes and other unexpected results.
:::

::: details MythicMobs entities not levelling properly? <br/> VanillaMobs.yml in MythicMobs
Around MythicMobs version 5.2.6 there was a change made in the default configuration of the MythicMobs installation which enables by default the scaling/levelling of entities via their own mechanics that are entirely separate from LevelledMobs. LevelledMobs detects a fully created entity and then applies levels to that entity; if MythicMobs' has their scaling system active that will mean they will start with varied and increasing stats before LevelledMobs even has a chance to adjust them.

In order to reset entities to their vanilla stat values, you could disable the scaling system within MythicMobs to use LevelledMobs' levelling exclusively, or vice-versa (of course we recommend using ours over theirs but it's your choice!). To disable, locate the `config.yml` file in your MythicMobs' installation, adn  set the `Enabled:` under each respective worlds/scenarios to `false.` to disable the scaling of MythicMobs for those scenarios. You can also adjust the Modifiers themselves to allow for some scaling controlled by MythicMobs.

::: details Chunk Kill Max Message <br/> "Your LevelledMobs kill count has reached the maximum for this area..."
![photo](/images/lm4/img_1.png)

This message is sent from the Chuck Kill Max system present within LevelledMobs.

These are a series of setting which reduce or disable the dropping of increased loot or experience points from mobs which are dying in the same area. This is mostly used for player based farms as to prevent cheating or abuse of the increased drops.

This system is controlled by two sets of settings; firstly the core functioning is located within a Custom Rule of the `rules.yml` file:

```yaml
  - custom-rule: 'Player Farm Item and XP Limiter'
    is-enabled: true
    settings:
      maximum-death-in-chunk-threshold: 15
      max-adjacent-chunks: 5
      chunk-max-cooldown-seconds: 10m
      disable-vanilla-drops-on-chunk-max: false
      disable-item-boost-on-chunk-max: true
      disable-xp-boost-on-chunk-max: true      
```

To disable the feature entirely, you can set this rule to `false`, or explicitly set `maximum-death-in-chunk-threshold:` to `0` to effectively disable the feature as well.

If you want the feature to remain working, but simply do not want the message sent to players, you can use the config option in `settings.yml` to disable the message by setting it to `false`.
```yaml
# ||  When player kill exceed amount of levelled mobs in
# ||  a chunk(within given period). Should we send message
# ||  to player to inform him?
exceed-kill-in-chunk-message: true
```
Finally, you can also edit the message sent to players within the `messages.yml` file.
```yaml
other:
  no-drop-in-chunk: '%prefix% &7Your levelled mob kill count has reached the maximum for this area. You will no longer receive levelled drops from these mobs. Please come back after a while.'
```
:::

::: details Prefer the LevelledMob3 version of the nametag?
Edit your `nametag:` configuration as demonstrated below:
```yaml
nametag: '&8&l‡º∫ %tiered%Lvl %mob-lvl%&8 | &f%displayname%&8 | &f%entity-health-rounded%&8/&f%entity-max-health-rounded% %tiered%%heart-symbol% &8&l‡ºª'
```
