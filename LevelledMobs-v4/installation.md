## ðŸ¤– Installation

Note: The difference between being **Compatible** and providing **Support**:

If an option is **Supported**, that simply means that our staff will be willing to resolve an issue, bug, or question concerning that option should a solution be available. It means that we intend for our plugin to be **Supported**, or functional, for the listed option. It does not mean that we can provide an answer to every possible combination of issues which may be occurring on your server.

If an option is **Compatible**, that simply relays to you the degree to which you should expect our plugin to function while on your server without issues or errors. We cannot account for every situation, but if an option is listed having a high degree of **Compatibility**, then you should expect that plugin to function as intended on your server. If you are experiencing an issue with a listed compatible option, we recommend first investigating if other plugins may be causing an issue. You can do this by running your testing server with just LevelledMobs and see if the issue is reproducible. If it is not, then return more plugins to the server until you have discovered the incompatible plugin. If this does not resolve the issue, then you might suggest submitting the question to the [ArcanePlugins Support Discord](https://discord.gg/arcaneplugins-752310043214479462).

## Are you running a supported Minecraft version?

| Minecraft Version | Compatibility | Support | Notes                                                           | 
|-------------------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.15* and before  | No            | No      | Support and Compatibility dropped with `3.1.0 b473`             |
| 1.16* - 1.18*     | No            | No      | Support and Compatibility dropped with `4.0.0 b1`               |
| 1.19* - 1.20*     | Yes           | Yes     | * Support may be dropped in favor of future Minecraft releases. | 
| Latest [ 1.21* ]  | Yes           | Yes     |                                                                 |

* **TLDR of paragraph below:**

We can only maintain support for the latest of the Minecraft version we offer support for. For example, 1.19 refers to support for 1.19.4, the end of the 1.19 branch.

---

When each branch of Minecraft is released (IE. 1.18, 1.19, 1.20, etc.), those branches are typically broken into multiple versions (IE 1.18.1, 1.19.2, 1.20.3, etc.). As each branch is updated, we will make every effort to keep up with the latest release of that particular branch. 

Sometimes, there are updates from one version to the next (IE 1.20.1 -> 1.20.2) which can result in a change that brakes previous versions of the server software or plugins written ofr that server software. Since the industry standard is to maintain support and compatibility for the latest versions of a branch as opposed to specified releases for each sub-version, that is all we have the resources to maintain. We recognize that there are some server types which rely on being on outdated server software. You may investigate the release history of LevelledMobs and find the corresponding version to when your server version was released, and use those likely functional but outdated versions. They will come with no support, as we simply do not have the resources to maintain build-specific versions of the plugin.

In general, we strive to commit to a two-version layer of compatibility and support. That means whatever version of minecraft is currently available, plus the previous two version. For example, for **Minecraft 1.20** support, we intend to also provide support for the latest release versions of **Minecraft 1.18-1.19** as well. This cannot always be the case, and sometimes there is compatibility beyond the two-versions even if support isn't provided. Users are always notified if there is a change worth noting with regards to support or compatibility changes.

### Are you running the correct Jaa version?

We currently require users to be running **Java 17** or higher. As of **Minecraft 1.16**, servers have been required to have at least **Java 17**, so this should not be an issue. Our support staff will not assist in managing your Java installation, as there are many free tutorials available on the internet.

As of [Minecraft Snapshot 24w14a [pre-1.20.5]](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w14a). the base game requires **Java 21** or higher to function. This will almost certainly apply to the final release version. If you intend to use LevelledMobs 4, and intend to use 1.20+ Minecraft servers, then it's highly suggested you use **Java 21** or higher.

Our staff recommend using [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/). It provides an implementation of the Java Standard software for your Java Standard software for your Java installation requirements. It is both *Free* and *open-source*, and the code is derived directly from the GPL-licensed binaries which are also *open-source*.

### Did you install any plugins with known issues?

We have discovered over several years that there are certain specific and non-specific plugins which either fail entirely, cause inconsistencies with LevelledMobs, break native features we use or cause unintended effects. Some of these issues contain solutions, some do not. It is not for us to resolve every potential issue with every plugin on the internet; even though we make the effort all the time.

| [mcMMO](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/official-mcmmo-original-author-returns.64348/)               | Good           | This plugin contains it's own mo health bar function which should be disabled if you use LevelledMobs' nametag feature to prevent double nametags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We utilize false packets to send nametag information directly to the players' client. Anything which interferes with this process may affect the nametags of entities.                                                                                                   |

### Did you install LevelledMobs in the proper location?

You might think it would be obvious, if you made it this far, that you should know where you install plugins you download for your Minecraft server. To be very clear: the LevelledMobs `.jar` file needs to be placed inside the `/plugins/` folder of your Minecraft server's root location. If your server installation doesn't have a `/plugins/` folder, then it has either not been installed properly or you are not running a compatible or supported server software. Please diagnose this issue yourself.

### [Optional] Did you install any supported plugins?

We provide multiple optional features and functionalities through integrations with several different plugins. There are also some extended-feature plugins created by our own ArcanePlugins Developers which provide expanded abilities within CustomDrops and beyond. If you want to use these optional features, you need to install the latest version of the respective plugin.
