# ðŸ“¦ Moving from LM3 to LM4

**We highly recommend, for every release of LevelledMobs (and any other plugin for that matter) that you first test this plugin on a testing server before applying to any live server.**

**Even if we are confident in the quality and stability of our work, we obviously cannot account for every potential change in a servers' software, or every combination of plugins which might interact or affect ours. Testing this plugin and it's interaction with the others on your server, in a testing environment, will almost always ensure compatibility with the other products of your server.**

**Skipping this step, and any resulting issues,m will not be our responsibility.**

**LevelledMobs 4** functions in a similar way to **LevelledMobs 3**, and even the configuration files are fairly similar. However this plugin should be considered by everyone an entirely new plugin. Even though it has gone through over a year of development, with two entire re-writes, and several months of behind-the-scenes tweaking and testing, that does not mean that we have prevented or solved every possible issue.

For most the biggest issue they will encounter is that previous `rules.yml` file generated from LevelledMobs 3 will be incompatible with our 4th version.

Of course we first suggest that you experience **LevelledMobs 4** as it is out-of-the-box and see if you want to incorporate the many changes and new features into your old setup.

Second, if you want to retain your old setup, you could consult this wiki and the [LM 3](https://github.com/ArcanePlugins/LevelledMobs/wiki) wiki, and recreate your rules taking note of the changes in name and formatting of various settings. For most files, it would take about five to ten minutes to convert over a file by hand.

If you are genuinely struggling to convert your LM 3 installation to LM 4's formatting, you can ask for assistance in the [official Support Discord](https://discord.gg/arcaneplugins-752310043214479462). To be entirely plain, we are not going to redo your file for you; we will help point to where you've made mistakes in the conversion.
