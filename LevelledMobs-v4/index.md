### Do you need to update LevelledMobs?

Updating LevelledMobs4 is as easy as downloading the latest release of the plugin from one of the above download links and replacing the previous `.jar` file. No need to change your rules from one update to the next. In most cases, we are able to push updates to your configuration which would not break it's functionality, however there may be instances where we will recommend letting a new Rules file to generate or for you to reference the latest version to see any new features or interesting tweaks made.

The plugin itself will notify you once at server startup of any available update from Spigot or Hangar.
